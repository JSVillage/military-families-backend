This is the only work that occurs in the main thread.\n *\n *  - We normalize and de-duplicate events to account for browser quirks. This\n *    may be done in the worker thread.\n *\n *  - Forward these native events (with the associated top-level type used to\n *    trap it) to `EventPluginHub`, which in turn will ask plugins if they want\n *    to extract any synthetic events.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` will then process each event by annotating them with\n *    \"dispatches\", a sequence of listeners and IDs that care about that event.\n *\n *  - The `EventPluginHub` then dispatches the events.\n *\n * Overview of React and the event system:\n *\n * +------------+    .\n * |    DOM     |    .\n * +------------+    .\n *       |           .\n *       v           .\n * +------------+    .\n * | ReactEvent |    .\n * |  Listener  |    .\n * +------------+    .                         +-----------+\n *       |           .               +--------+|SimpleEvent|\n *       |           .               |         |Plugin     |\n * +-----|------+    .               v         +-----------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+                    +------------+\n * |     +-----------.--->|EventPluginHub|                    |    Event   |\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  | Propagators|\n * | ReactEvent |    .    |              |     |TapEvent   |  |------------|\n * |  Emitter   |    .    |              |<---+|Plugin     |  |other plugin|\n * |            |    .    |              |     +-----------+  |  utilities |\n * |     +-----------.--->|              |                    +------------+\n * |     |      |    .    +--------------+\n * +-----|------+    .                ^        +-----------+\n *       |           .                |        |Enter/Leave|\n *       +           .                +-------+|Plugin     |\n * +-------------+   .                         +-----------+\n * | application |   .\n * |-------------|   .\n * |             |   .\n * |             |   .\n * +-------------+   .\n *                   .\n *    React Core     .

Many of these soldiers are veterans returning from service in Afghanistan and Iraq. Society must take action against this crisis.</p>\n            \t\t\t<p>This is a web based application to help veterans find mental health services with a focus on PTSD in the State of Arizona. The application filters only required information so users can get straight to point and find services in the valley near them for emotional support via events and or forum discussion.</p>\n            \t\t\t<p>The idea for this project was proposed by Martin Patino, who noticed the difficulty in finding PTSD information. He helped put together a group of diverse developers who are interested in helping this cause. This project was made possible by the organizers of JS Village and the Phoenix JavaScript meetup.</p>\n            \t\t</div>\n            \t\t<div className=\"col-md-offset-1 col-md-5\">\n                        <div id=\"about-photo\">\n                            <img className=\"img-responsive\" src=\"app/images/groupPhoto.jpg\"/>\n                            <p>From left to right: Moe Lubovac, Milan Prpa, Lizz Jolii, Martin Patino, Charmaine Gurule, Rebecca Snyder, Aaron Fischer</p>\n                        </div>\n            \t\t</div>\n            \t</div>\n            </div>\n\n        </div>;\n    }\n}\n\nAboutPage.propTypes = {};\n\nexport default AboutPage;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./client/components/about/AboutPage.js\n **/","import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport ContactPage from './ContactPage';\n\nclass ContactContainer extends Component {\n\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return <ContactPage />;\n    }\n}\n\nexport default ContactContainer;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./client/components/contact/ContactContainer.js\n **/","import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\n\nclass ContactPage extends Component {\n\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return <div>\n            Contact Page\n        </div>;\n    }\n}\n\nContactPage.propTypes = {};\n\nexport default ContactPage;\n\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./client/components/contact/ContactPage.js\n **/","import React, { Component, PropTypes } from 'react';\nimport ResourcesPage from './ResourcesPage';\n\nclass ResourcesContainer extends Component {\n    \n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return <ResourcesPage />;\n    }\n}\n\nResourcesContainer.propTypes = {};\n\nexport default ResourcesContainer;\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./client/components/resources/ResourcesContainer.js\n **/","import React, {Component, PropTypes} from 'react';\nimport {Link} from 'react-router';\n\nclass ResourcesPage extends Component {\n\n    constructor(props) {\n        super(props);\n    }\n\n    render() {\n        return <div>\n          <div className=\"resources\">\n\n            <h1>Resources</h1>\n\n            <div className=\"container\">\n                <div className=\"row text-center\">\n\n                    <div className=\"col-md-3\">\n                        <Link to=\"/resources/funding\">\n                            <i className=\"fa fa-dollar fa-4x\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n                            <h4 className=\"heading\">Funding</h4>\n                        </Link>\n                        <p>Everyone needs financial help at some point in their lives.\n                          These sites will help with financial issues that often come up after returning from duty.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"col-md-3\">\n                        <Link to=\"/resources/education\">\n                            <i className=\"fa fa-university fa-4x\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n                            <h4 className=\"heading\">Education</h4>\n                        </Link>\n                        <p>Schools can often provide a community to help to handle the lifestyle changes veterans experience when coming home from active duty.\n                        There are many resources for veterans interested in furthering their education.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"col-md-3\">\n                        <Link to=\"/resources/healthcare\">\n                            <i className=\"fa fa-medkit fa-4x\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n                            <h4 className=\"heading\">Healthcare</h4>\n                        </Link>\n                        <p>The V.A. helps with medical issues for both veterans and their family members.\n                        Outside sources can be hard to find, but they are available through the right channels.</p>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className=\"col-md-3\">\n                        <Link to=\"/resources/jobs\">\n                            <i className=\"fa fa-briefcase fa-4x\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n                            <h4 className=\"heading\">Jobs</h4>\n                        </Link>\n                        <p>The job market can seem like a roller coaster.
